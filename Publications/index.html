<p>Y. He, X. Zhang, Y. Zhao and Y. Zhang, “An incentive mechanism for cross-silo federated learning to maximize social welfare” (under review)<br>Abs：<br>Due to business concerns and privacy regulations, companies hesitate to share their vast amount of data samples to train machine learning models, which is known as the problem of data silos.<br>Cross-silo Federated Learning (FL) is a framework for companies to collaboratively initiate some FL projects to break down data silos. Specifically, in cross-silo FL, the participating companies train local models using their local data, and periodically push their model updates to a global parameter server for model aggregation without sharing their raw data. After training process, the derived model are available to all participants. However, each company would get different utility from the model derived by the cross-silo FL and spend different cost on participating the training process. Besides, a participating company can free-ride the derived model with others even if nothing pays it. Accordingly, it becomes an very important issue to guarantee the fairness among all participating data owners and keep the economic attractiveness of cross-silo FL, i.e. participating in cross-silo FL is beneficial. To address these issues, we propose an incentive mechanism based on Vickrey Clarke Groves (VCG) method for cross-silo FL, named Social Welfare Efficient Cross-silo FL incentive mechanism (SECF), which will maximize social welfare and achieve some other desirable objectives, e.g. incentive compatibility, individual rationality and weak budget balance. We analyze the theoretical performance of SECF and conduct extensive experiments on a real testbed based on MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of SECF.</p>
<p>Y. Liu, X. Zhang, Y. Zhao, Y. He, S. Yu, and K. Zhu, “Chronos: Accelerating federated learning with resource aware training volume tuning at network edges” (in revision, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology)<br>Abs：<br>Due to the limited resources and data privacy issue, last decade witnesses the fast development of Distributed Machine Learning (DML) at network edges. Among all the<br>existing DML paradigms, Federated Learning (FL) would be a promising one, since in FL, each client trains its local model without sharing the raw data with others. A community of clients with the same interest can join together to derive a highperformance model by periodically synchronizing the parameters of their local models under the help of a coordination server. However, FL will encounter the straggler problem at network<br>edges, and hence the synchronization among clients becomes inefficient. It slows down the convergence speed of learning process. To alleviate the straggler problem, we propose a method named Chronos1 that accelerates FL with training volume tuning<br>in this paper. More specifically, Chronos is a resource aware method that adaptively adjusts the amount of data used by each client for training (i.e. training volume) in each iteration in order to eliminate the synchronization waiting time caused by the heterogeneous and dynamical computing and communication resources. In addition, we theoretically analyze the convergence of Chronos. Extensive experiments show that compared with the benchmark algorithms (i.e. BSP and SSP), Chronos significantly improves convergence speed by up to 18Xand 5X, respectively.</p>
<p>Z. Zeng, Z.Xia, X. Zhang and Y. He, “SFC design and VNF placement based on traffic volume scaling and VNF dependency in 5G networks” (accepted by Computer Modeling in Engineering &amp; Sciences)<br>Abs：<br>The development of Fifth-Generation (5G) mobile communication technology has remarkably promoted the spread of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. As a promising paradigm for IoT, edge computing can process amount of data generated by mobile intelligent devices in less time response. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) that decouples network functions from dedicated hardware is an important architecture to implement edge computing, deploying heterogeneous Virtual Network Functions (VNF) (such as computer vision, natural language processing, intelligent control, etc.) on the edge service nodes. With the NFV MANO (Management and Orchestration) framework, a Service Function Chain (SFC) that contains a set of ordered VNFs can be constructed and placed in the network to offer a customized network service. However, the procedure of NFV orchestration faces a technical challenge in minimizing network cost of VNF placement due to the complexity of the changing effect of traffic volume and the dependency of VNF relationship. To this end, we jointly optimize SFC design and VNF placement for minimizing resource cost while taking account of VNF dependency and traffic volume scaling. First, the problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model and proved NP-hard by reduction from Hamiltonian Cycle problem. Then we proposed an efficient heuristic algorithm called Traffic Aware and Interdependent VNF Placement (TAIVP) to solve the problem. Compared with the benchmark algorithms, emulation results show that our algorithm can reduce network cost by 10.2% and increase service request acceptance rate by 7.6% in average.</p>
